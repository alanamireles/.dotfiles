#During this process, I encountered a few hurdles. The biggest trouble I had was trying to get to the VIM command line so that I could complete steps 7-10. Once I had gotten help on that, it became a more straighfoward process to complete the rest of the lab. But before I could do that, I had a little troubloe trying to get back into the VIM command line so that I could write this little summary and my name. I think this little guided lab challenged me a bit, but I learned to do much more now.
